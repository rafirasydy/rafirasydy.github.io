        We're now able to update on timings for PLR statements and payments, following the recent delays to
        distribution. We expect statements and payments, where due, to be distributed as follows:
    </div>
    <div class="om">
        <p>
            1. Irish statements distributed week commencing 29 January 2024<br>
            2. Irish payments made between 19 Februaryâ€“1 March 2024<br>
            3. UK statements distributed week commencing 26 February 2024<br>
            4. UK payments made between 18â€“29 March 2024.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="on">
        <p>If you normally receive a hard-copy statement, you should expect it to arrive in the post as normal.
            Otherwise, as PLR online accounts remain unavailable, we'll email a statement to you. This will come from
            plrservices@mail.plr.bl.uk, but please check your spam folder if you donâ€™t receive it.

            We apologise for the delay in getting statements out. This disruption was caused by a major technology
            outage following the cyber-attack on the British Library. We're making good progress to restore online PLR
            accounts and resume normal services as soon as we can.</p>

        <h2>Registering for Manchester</h2>
        <p>We're currently unable to register new users for PLR payments. However, the deadline to register for
            inclusion in next year's payments is not until 30 June 2024. We are making good progress towards having a
            registration system working in advance of this date.</p>

    <div class="ov">
        <h2>Registering new titles and amending your details</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, PLR online accounts are currently unavailable for users to amend personal details or register
            books. We're working hard to reinstate access before the end of the PLR year on 30 June 2024. In the
            meantime you can contact us and we'll advise you on the next steps to amend your details, or you can
            complete and send us this Additional Book Registration Form (PDF, 0.5mb) to register any new titles.</p>
        <p><b>Please note, due to the current circumstances, you will be required to complete additional security checks
                including verification of your identity and postal address before we can make changes to your
                personal information. This is to help protect your account from potential fraudulent activity.</b></p>

        <h2>Legal deposit</h2>
        <p>Legal deposit is the statutory obligation to deposit at least one copy of every publication from the UK and
            Ireland, free of charge, at the British Library and other designated deposit libraries.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are currently unable to receive digital legal deposit content via the publisher submission portal.
            Publishers who want to upload their titles via the portal are advised to contact the Digital Processing Team
            at the British Library by emailing LDO-Electronic@bl.uk, who will be happy to advise on alternative deposit
            options.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Digital Processing Team will also forward requests from Scottish and Welsh publishers to their national
            deposit libraries, and requests from Irish publishers to the Library of Trinity College Dublin.
            <br>
            <br>
            For those publishers who do not have an agreement to deposit digitally we are still accepting print legal
            deposit. To send us your publication, please post a copy to:
